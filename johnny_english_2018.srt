1
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,132
Oh, bollocks.

2
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,805
We've got a problem.

3
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,474
A cyber attack?
Yes. Prime Minister.

4
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,477
Took me
two bottles of wine

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,397
and half a packet of sleeping
pills to finally nod off.

6
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:50,026
And you wake me because some fat-fingered
hacker's pinched your PIN number?

7
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,921
Well, it's a little more serious
than that, Prime Minister.

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,863
Hmm?
The identities of every one

9
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,949
of our serving agents
have been exposed.

10
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,993
What?

11
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,120
Who's doing this?
We're not sure. ma'am.

12
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:03,039
So one week before I host
my first G12 Summit,

13
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,333
Britain's entire security
apparatus has been taken down

14
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,835
and you know absolutely nothing?

15
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:09,671
That does pretty much sums up
the situation, ma'am, yes.

16
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,732
Well, you better get someone on
it and find me some answers!

17
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:14,026
Yes, but that's the problem.
We don't have any agents left.

18
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,093
They've all been outed.

19
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,595
So bring back an old one!

20
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,488
All units, this is Juliet Echo.
Stand by for target coordinates.

21
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,995
Target acquired.
Repeat, target acquired.

22
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,807
Now then, what have we here?

23
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,227
Sorry, sir.

24
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,979
Never mind, Baggaley.

25
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:11,107
Your concealment and camouflage
work is definitely improving.

26
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,317
Thank you, sir.

27
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:13,526
Come on.

28
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,528
You, too, Ibadulla.

29
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,823
Excellent. That is
a first-class man-trap.

30
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,368
Six house points.

31
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,330
Right, let's get back
to school before matron

32
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,849
notices you're missing.

33
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,417
And don't worry, there aren't
any more booby traps.

34
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,589
Apart from this one, of course.

35
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:50,814
Mr. English?

36
00:03:51,106 --> 00:03:52,607
We haven't seen him, sir.

37
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,192
Huh.

38
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:58,238
And that's camouflage.

39
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,158
Hmm.

40
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,497
And go.

41
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,666
And go.

42
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,876
And go.

43
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,004
The welfare of your children
is our paramount concern.

44
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,382
They're never exposed
to any unnecessary risk,

45
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,883
I assure you.

46
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,898
I think that's an "F" for your bomb
disposal coursework, Hattersley.

47
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:37,026
"You're looking particularly
beautiful tonight."

48
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,572
You're looking
particularly beautiful tonight.

49
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:41,865
"Ching!"

50
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,450
Ching!

51
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,079
Have a good half-term, sir!
Thank you.

52
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,301
Are you seriously telling me
this is all we've got?

53
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,761
Most of them are either dead,

54
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,680
having hip operations or
recovering from prostate surgery.

55
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,767
Okay.

56
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:55,146
Before your briefing, we'll need you
to re-sign the Official Secrets Aot.

57
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,439
Thank you.

58
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,857
Thank you.

59
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:58,942
Thank you.

60
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,944
Thank you very much.

61
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,613
Any of you
gentlemen remember this?

62
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,617
Ooh, the Mont Blanc Blaster.
Havenfiseen one of those for years.

63
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:12,539
Take the cap off and, if memory serves,
you've 20 seconds to replace it

64
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:15,500
or it detonates with the force
of a stun grenade.

65
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,313
Thank you.

66
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:42,360
Teas on the left, gentlemen.

67
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,445
And coffees on the right.

68
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,947
Excellent.

69
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,033
Oh, damn it, I forgot my pills.

70
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,327
<i>Here, have some of m'me.</i>

71
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,998
Scotch whisky, single malt?

72
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,958
Thank you very much.

73
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,168
Coffee.
Oh.

74
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,504
Here, let me help you with that.

75
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,885
Tea?

76
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,144
Ooh, this one just needs
a little top-up of hot water.

77
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,229
I'll be right back.

78
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,358
Man's a divot
of the first order.

79
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,777
Someone should put him
out of his misery.

80
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,947
Along with whoever
furnished this room.

81
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:30,116
MkvCage.ws

82
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,204
Oh!

83
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,500
Ah, good morning.
Sorry to keep you.

84
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,212
Are the others here?

85
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,756
Um...

86
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,008
Oh.

87
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,724
They, um... They nodded off.

88
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:56,267
Right...

89
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,811
And who are you exactly?

90
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,396
EngHsh.

91
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,066
- Johnny English.
- Well...

92
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,027
“English...“

93
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:08,821
You'll leave immediately.

94
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,990
My people will give you
the full briefing en route.

95
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,408
Oh, is there anything you need?

96
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:16,204
Yes, nerve gas nasal spray,
a type-four exoskeleton...

97
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,247
You should probably
start a list.

98
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,793
And a garroting watch, with a rubber
strap, not the steel bracelet

99
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,254
because the links get caught in
the little hairs on my wrist.

100
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,674
Oh, and I'll also need a Bough.

101
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,717
What's a Bough?

102
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,095
Sir!

103
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,015
Wonderful to see you!

104
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,936
Yes, all right, Bough. We're going
on a mission, not a honeymoon.

105
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,771
Yes, of course, sir.

106
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,441
Ah. I think it's the pin of your
buckle, sir. It's caught on myjumper.

107
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,877
Yes, I can see
what's wrong, Bough.

108
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,071
If you go to your left
and I'll go to my right.

109
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:54,701
I'm sorry, no, if you go to your
right and I'll go to my left.

110
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,289
No. If I go clockwise
and you go anti-clockwise...

111
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,810
Er, no, I think that's
making it worse, sir.

112
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,253
Hmm. I'm surprised
that didn't work.

113
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,678
Good morning, sir. I have your
agent activation pack here.

114
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,888
Department-issue smartphone.

115
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,268
580-megapixel camera,
4.7-inch retina HD display.

116
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:25,356
Hmm-hmm. Ingenious. And what
does it shoot? Poison darts?

117
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,694
It doesn't shoot anything.
It's a phone.

118
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,196
There's a Twitter handle,
Instagram feed

119
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,282
and secure login for the
department Uber account.

120
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,405
What's he on about, Bough?

121
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,577
I need a weapon.
Not a box of gobbledygook.

122
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,121
I think, uh, what Agent English

123
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,498
is getting at, sir, is all
this is highly trackable.

124
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,169
But since we're dealing with a very
sophisticated, digital target,

125
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:50,840
we might be less visible if we took
a more analog, low-tech approach.

126
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,593
Exactly.

127
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,345
I see.

128
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,681
Is there anything else
I can get you?

129
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,433
<i>A gun.</i>

130
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,147
We don't really do guns anymore.

131
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:08,107
Just get him a gun.

132
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,817
Right, a gun.

133
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,535
Right. Haven't actually done
one of these before.

134
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,830
"It is my obligation
under section 14

135
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,767
"of the Health and Safety
Directive to inform you

136
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,460
"that the equipment with which
you are about to be issued

137
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:29,462
"can cause injury
and bodily harm.

138
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,010
"Furthermore, any agents
with nut allergies

139
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,279
"should be aware
that traces of cashew oil..."

140
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,638
Thank you.

141
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,683
Right, transport.

142
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,523
So, take any hybrid you want.

143
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,665
I'll take this one.

144
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:08,960
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
English. This car is a relic.

145
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,838
Drinks petrol, leaks oil
and has no passive,

146
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,589
let alone
active safety features.

147
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,275
Do you know what else
it doesn't have, sir?

148
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,052
Satellite navigation
or a single computer chip.

149
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:21,389
Making it completely invisible
to a digital enemy.

150
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,476
The equipment
Agent English requested, sir.

151
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,769
Thank you.

152
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,689
Phone. Bough?
Yeah.

153
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:36,070
That hi-tech villain of yours
will never see us coming.

154
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,423
Let's see
what they've given us.

155
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,845
Exoskeleton, exploding cotton
buds, the old shoebox inflatable.

156
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,138
Hmm.

157
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:07,476
Ooh. what are these? Instant
Release Super High Energy Pills.

158
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,814
Like sticking your fingers in an
electric socket. Highly recommended.

159
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,860
Right, so, the red ones must be the
Total Knockout Sleeping Pills.

160
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,069
Correct.

161
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,447
Hmm. Probably worth
labeling these.

162
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,573
Oh.

163
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,075
Look, sir. Sweeties.

164
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,161
Ooh.

165
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,455
Hang on a minute.

166
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,415
I always did love a jelly baby.

167
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,585
I wouldn't if I was you, Bough.
"Jelly" is short for gelignite.

168
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,438
One bite and it'll take
the top of your head off

169
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,130
along with the roof of the car.

170
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,466
So, what does this do?

171
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,594
It's a mixtape, Bough.

172
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,684
- So, destination?
- South of France, sir.

173
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:50,770
That cyber attack
seems to have been launched

174
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,314
from the Wi-Fi signal
of a hotel in Antibes.

175
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:41,362
Sir? Sir, I've just had
a fax through from HQ.

176
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,907
Background checks on all the guests
that accessed the Wi-Fi network.

177
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,118
You see? Who needs email?

178
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,125
Um...

179
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,544
One name has raised
a red flag, sir.

180
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,256
Sebastian Lynch, ex-Army
and Military Intelligence.

181
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,342
Now selling his services
to the highest bidder.

182
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,303
Where do we find him?
Directly ahead. sir.

183
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:11,183
He's got an 8:00 reservation
at the Cote de Roc restaurant.

184
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,057
The problem's going to be getting
close enough for a full surveillance, sir.

185
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,158
Not necessarily.

186
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:47,053
Oh, darling, I've just
gotta get this. Two seconds.

187
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:51,974
Simple plan, two parts. You provide
the distraction, I'll get the phone.

188
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:54,393
Yes. sir.
And from now on,

189
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:59,732
perhaps we
should sound like French waiters.

190
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,277
French waiters?

191
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,404
Yees.

192
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,115
Go on.

193
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,915
Are you finished now, Sebasfian?

194
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,709
Bread roll?

195
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,044
Yes, thank you.

196
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,379
Excellent choice,
<i>madame.</i>

197
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,257
Good evening.

198
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:27,426
How are you?

199
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,721
Bread roll, sir?

200
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,264
Yes. Thank you.

201
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,562
One second.

202
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,773
Excuse me, would you mind?

203
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,818
Oh, yes. Evening.

204
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,486
Evening.

205
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:01,168
Thank you.

206
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,600
Where's my phone?

207
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,645
That is your phone.

208
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,566
Ooh.

209
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,238
Thank you.

210
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,574
<i>Monsieur.</i>

211
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:36,036
The, uh, shell on my wife's lobster,
could you remove it, please?

212
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,415
Yees.

213
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,126
Uh...

214
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,544
Hmm.

215
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,842
Let me crack it for you.

216
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,024
Oh!

217
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:06,984
Ow!

218
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,600
Hello?

219
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:45,046
Steve, I'll have to
call you back. Call you back.

220
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,484
Give me a sec. Hang on.

221
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,445
What is going on?

222
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:56,992
Sebastian, don't get involved.

223
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,664
Ah.

224
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,337
What is he doing? SEBASTIAN:
I don't know. He's a fool.

225
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,006
There we are.

226
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:14,468
<i>Voila.</i>

227
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,103
Hmm. Bon appétit.

228
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,359
I will talk to the manager.
I will talk to the manager.

229
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,620
Textbook, Bough.

230
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,918
Just
holiday snaps, sir.

231
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:51,046
Wait a minute, this photo.

232
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:55,134
It was taken the same day our villain
accessed the Wi-Fi, and look.

233
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,761
Scarcely 50 feet from shore.

234
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,931
Whoever was on that yacht

235
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,767
could easily have used
the hotel's Wi-Fi,

236
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,021
sent that signal
and then just sailed away.

237
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:12,234
I think it's time
we paid the Dot <i>Calm</i> a visit.

238
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,956
<i>Algorithms.</i>

239
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,250
<i>We are surrounded by them.</i>

240
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,502
<i>Algorithms run our lives,</i>

241
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:35,049
<i>choose our TV shows, stream our music.
Even find us a date.</i>

242
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,844
I know this chap, don't I?

243
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:42,222
Yes, he's that Silicon Valley
billionaire who dated a Kardashian.

244
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,017
Two Kardashians and a Black-Eyed Pea.
Keep watching.

245
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,437
<i>But supposing there was an
algorithm for an entire country.</i>

246
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,107
<i>A single algorithm that could be
applied to every one of its problems.</i>

247
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:56,528
<i>A single algorithm that could take
a second-rate nation and make it</i>

248
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,947
<i>world class.</i>

249
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,701
<i>Every nation is awash with data.</i>

250
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:08,040
So now, more than ever, we need to put
that data to work for the people.

251
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,418
These few lines of code will
deliver the kind of change

252
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:14,296
they have been dreaming of
their entire lives.

253
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:17,466
<i>I am Xander. I love data.</i>

254
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,429
He's so clever.

255
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,474
He's young, he's sexy,
he's insanely successful.

256
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,560
Just the qualities we need
people to associate with me.

257
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:30,938
Yes, Prime Minister.

258
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,565
And they will do when he
starts working with us.

259
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,276
But why would 3 Silicon Valley
billionaire work with us?

260
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:39,113
Just get him into Number 10
and let me work on him.

261
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,614
Yes. ma'am.
Go on.

262
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:44,785
Oh, God, now what?

263
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,888
There's been another attack,
Prime Minister.

264
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,247
Air Traffic Control.
Oh!

265
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:51,792
Someone's rerouted every
flight in Europe to Luton.

266
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,104
For God's sake, tell me the
agent you've got in the field

267
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,838
is making some progress?

268
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,308
So, how are we gonna
findthelocafion of that yacht, sir?

269
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,770
Very easily, Bough.
We ring MI7.

270
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:19,361
HeHo, heHo? Yes, I need the
location of a boat called...

271
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,827
Hello? Hello, yes.
A boat called the Dot Calm.

272
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,705
Yes, it's a play
on words. Yeah.

273
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,039
Where?

274
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,715
Looks about
half a mile out, sir.

275
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:43,010
Do we wanna try
and swim it or...

276
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:46,555
No, Bough. This is a job for
the shoebox inflatable.

277
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,307
No, don't open it
in the car, sir!

278
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,816
Can you reach your door handle?

279
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,820
No, sir.

280
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,656
I'll try my side.

281
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:26,053
Right, Bough, our aim is to get
on board without anyone noticing.

282
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,263
And how are we gonna do it?

283
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,849
Magnetic boots.
Brilliant, sir.

284
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,143
Simple mechanism.

285
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:36,396
Left switch activates left boot.
Right switch activates right.

286
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,941
Okay, let's go.

287
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,336
Remember, the absolutely vital
element of this mission is surprise.

288
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,877
Now, you have to get up
pretty early in the morning

289
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,028
to outwit British Intelligence.

290
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,286
Quick!

291
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:41,295
Good evening, gentlemen.

292
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,590
Shall we start with your names?

293
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:48,677
Clearly you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

294
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,014
That's why I'm starting
with your names.

295
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,433
Actually, would you mind
coming down here?

296
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,227
It's really hard to have
a conversation like this.

297
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,272
I have a better idea.

298
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,656
It's no good,
it won't move, sir.

299
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,367
We'll see about that.

300
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,828
Low-intensity
exploding cotton bud.

301
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,209
That's quite a powerful charge
for such a small space, sir.

302
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,711
Oh, nonsense.

303
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,132
There will just be a slight pop.

304
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,100
Shall we locate the hold and
look for the source of that signal?

305
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,147
I think we should locate the hold
and look for the source of that signal!

306
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,652
Come on!

307
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,041
I'd say we have
our villain, Bough!

308
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,335
You need to keep
your voice down, sir.

309
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,213
And we're not going to lose him.

310
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,978
Hand me the sherbet fountain.

311
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,484
Three sucks and the location
transmitter is activated.

312
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:31,363
This gin palace will show up
as a hostile from 30,000 feet.

313
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,948
Hmm.

314
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,666
This is now an enemy target.

315
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,756
Aniseed balls.

316
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:08,108
If you'd wanted to kill me, you
would have already done so.

317
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,363
Till we meet again.

318
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,664
Ow!

319
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,546
Well, that was sooner
than I expected.

320
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,470
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

321
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,892
<i>Who do you
think she is, sir?</i>

322
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,644
Well, if she's not
the owner of that yacht,

323
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,188
then she knows who is.

324
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:49,816
Either way, she's the key
to this case.

325
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,197
Is it true you were teaching,
sir? Before all this blew up?

326
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,742
If by "teaching" you mean

327
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:03,830
scouting for potential intelligence
operatives then yes, I was.

328
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:04,998
Hmm.

329
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,753
I actually got married, sir.
I don't know if you heard.

330
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,339
No.

331
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,341
Hmm.

332
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,134
Yeah, Lydia.

333
00:27:16,218 --> 00:27:17,260
Lovely girl.

334
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,683
You never think about getting
hitched yourself, sir?

335
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:29,439
This is no life for a married man, Bough.
The danger, the constant travel.

336
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:30,607
Here you go, sir.

337
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,692
More Lydia's life
than mine, sir.

338
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,445
She's in the Navy, you see.

339
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,572
What, as a cook?

340
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:41,618
Or some kind of seagoing
secretary or...

341
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,579
Oh, no, sir. She's the captain
of a nuclear submarine.

342
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,249
Oh, right.

343
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,420
Do you think we should get some
petrol for the Aston, sir?

344
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,134
No. An Aston Martin is
surprisingly economical, Bough.

345
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:03,181
Besides, it looks like
we're in business.

346
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:18,405
Come on.

347
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,581
Looks like
an electric car, sir.

348
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,125
Yes, and sounds like
a nose hair trimmer.

349
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,837
A bunch
of triple-A batteries

350
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,548
is no match for old-fashioned
British horsepower.

351

<i>NOfllmCP 720252
MflMPEZO flcmmzyzd</i>

352
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,448
Look at her cornering. Seems so
effortless, doesn't it, sir?

353
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,405
Arm the missile.

354
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,615
The what?

355
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,951
The missile, Bough, the one
with the tear gas warhead.

356
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,578
But they're just cyclists, sir.
We'll get past in a minute.

357
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:49,902
They're French cyclists, Bough,

358
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,666
and they're obstructing
Her Majesty's Secret Service.

359
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,841
Wiper stalk
is armed, sir.

360
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,143
<i>Sorry.</i>

361
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,896
<i>Terribly sorry.
We do apologize.</i>

362
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:17,190
<i>Stop it, Bough,
you'll only encourage them.</i>

363
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,375
What are we gonna do now, sir?
Patience. Bough.

364
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:38,837
Driving like that, her battery
will be dead any moment.

365
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,215
And she'll roll
to a humiliating stop.

366
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,071
Bough, it is your job to
keep an eye onthefuelgauge.

367
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:14,914
Very impressive driving, Mr...

Basil Golightly.

370
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,884
And you're rather useful
yourself, Miss...

371
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:29,596
Bhuletova. Ophelia Bhuletova.

372
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,014
Hmm.

373
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,849
And this is...

374
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,225
Colin.

375
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:38,021
I thought we were
using fake names.

376
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,690
That is a fake name.

377
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,861
Oh, right.

378
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,740
Yes, this is Colin,

379
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,117
and I'm...

380
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,414
"Dasil."

Basil.

383
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,754
Well, Basil,

384
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,059
maybe there is a simpler way
of doing this.

385
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,175
Over a drink perhaps?

386
00:32:07,258 --> 00:32:09,636
Well, that would be lovely.

387
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:14,390
- Shall we say the bar at the Hotel
de Paris in Cagnes-sur-Mer? -00?

388
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,559
Mmm. It's a date.

389
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,941
Well,

390
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:27,695
I think my "running out of
fuel" ruse worked pretty well.

391
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,322
Mmm.

392
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,160
What?

393
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,764
Er, junior doctors. They've
confirmed they are going on strike

394
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,628
and the tube drivers
are coming out in support.

395
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,560
Oh, God. Leader of the Opposition, has
he come round from his heart surgery?

396
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,627
Yes, Prime Minister.

397
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,839
Oh, Jesus Christ, when will something
go right for me? What do you want?

398
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,675
They've hit us again,
Prime Minister.

399
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:51,719
Huh? Hacked into the Central
Traffic Control System.

400
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:55,431
Yes, they've turned every
traffic light in London to red.

401
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,686
Where's my bloody drink?

402
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,814
You've got to be joking?
Vodka tonic, no ice, no tonic.

403
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,441
Yes. ma'am. Oh. and Mr. Volta
has arrived. ma'am.

404
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,574
Mr. Volta,
welcome to Downing Street.

405
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,785
I have read so much
about this wonderful building.

406
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,414
Is this the stone triple staircase
designed by William Kent?

407
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,709
Um, yes, it probably is.
I can't swear to it.

408
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,378
- Can we do a quick...
<i>- Needs Photoshop.</i>

409
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,964
Oh!
This way. Hmm.

410
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,883
I am horribly late,
I do apologize.

411
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,802
It's the traffic, it's the one
thing I don't love about London.

412
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:35,346
Yes, well, I must admit
we are having a slight problem

413
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,348
with the lights at the moment.
Nothing major.

414
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:40,476
If you wanted, I could take a
look? It is kind of what I do.

415
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,188
I think it's actually a little
bit more complex than...

416
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:46,691
Xander, get a web address for
London's traffic control center.

417
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,070
<i>Here is the login page, Jason.

419
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:00,663
I won't tell if you won't.

00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,216
Someone is hacking you.
Oh, I don't think so.

423
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:15,386
Denied service attack.
Yeah, primitive but effective.

424
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:19,891
You know what we could try,
rerouting all service requests

425
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,101
to our server farm in Nevada.

426
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,395
Um...

427
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:27,398
<i>Rerouting, Jason.</i>

428
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,234

Crikey.

430
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,911
So, what was it you wanted
to talk to me about?

431
00:34:40,245 --> 00:34:42,372
You, Jason.

432
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,874
Get out.

433
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,542
I want to talk about you.

434
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,893
Excellent, Bough.
Nearly there.

435
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,229
Nearly there.

436
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,357
This is actually
a really nice hotel, Bough.

437
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,986
I'm turning to the right.

438
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:29,961
Shall one of us keep Miss Bhuletova busy
while the other searches her room, sir?

439
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:34,173
Good idea, Bough.
Alert me if you find anything.

440
00:35:56,321 --> 00:35:57,488
Mr. Golightly.

441
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,492
Oh...

442
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,202
Indeed.

443
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,290
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
On the contrary.

444
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,084
Wild horses couldn't
keep me away.

445
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,961

Evening. What would you like?

447
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,760
I'm feeling a little homesick tonight.
I'll have 3 Moscow Mule.

448
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,640
And I'll have a London...

449

Lemming, please.

450
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,355
I'm not sure, what...

451
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,984
It's, uh, gin, vodka,

452
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,779
armagnac,

453
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,822
sherry,

454
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,992
with just a little bit
of Parmesan.

455
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,877
So, what brings you to the

00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,885
Hmm.

461
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:07,183
And would this friend
be the owner of the Dot <i>Calm?</i>

462
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:09,435
Hmm.

463
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:10,728
Yes, he would.

464
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,361
And what about you,

465
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,445
Basil?

466
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,948
Oh, I'm just here on business.

467
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:25,201
Although, it's rapidly
turning into pleasure.

468
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,040
Ooh! I love these.

469
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,463
They're really hot.

470
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,182
Are you all right?

471
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,934
Yes, fine.

472
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,027
Hmm.

473
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:07,577
Cheers.

474
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:11,205
I'm not sure I've ever met a
man quite like you, Basil.

475
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,542
Let me clear up
the uncertainty for you.

476
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,544
You haven't.

477
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:35,188
I'm sorry, Basil. I have to get
up really early tomorrow morning.

478
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,106
Oh, that's a shame.

479
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,327
How did you get on, sir?

480
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:52,121
Oh, gosh, what a wonderful
woman, Bough. Wonderful.

481
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,247
Right.

482
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,249
Charming. Intelligent.

483
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:59,045
Lovely sense of humor. And
obviously entirely innocent.

484
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,298
Although, I broke into her room and
she does have three passports, sir.

485
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:05,218
Romanian, Bulgarian, Russian.
Different name in each.

486
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:08,221
So she's been married
to three different people.

487
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,348
Not unusual in this day
and age, Bough.

488
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,351
And I also found some garroting
wire and two boxes of ammunition.

489
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:18,272
Well, single woman, traveling
alone, you can't be too careful.

490
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,401
You don't think
she might be a spy, sir?

491
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,779
A spy?

492
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:28,282
I think I know
what a spy looks like, Bough.

493

494
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,746
Oh.

495
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,381
Oh!

496
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,244
Ah.

497
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,729
Sir?

498
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,022
Sir!

499
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,358
I just got off the phone
to P in London.

500
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,003
He's found out who the
owner of that yaoht is.

501
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,028
Jason Volta.

502
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,322
The world's most powerful
Internet billionaire, sir!

503
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,782
And he's in London, right now.

504
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:41,285
The Prime Minister is personally
negotiating a trade deal with him.

505
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,871
Well, what are we waiting for?

506
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,947
Do you think we might
slow down a little, sir?

507
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:19,824
What?

508
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,410
Never mind!

509
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,460
<i>With what appears
to be another cyber attack,</i>

510
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,938
<i>pressure is mounting
on the Prime Minister.</i>

511
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:34,922
Every train in England?
Yes. sir.

512
00:44:35,005 --> 00:44:38,092
They're all trying to terminate
at Bristol Temple Meads.

513
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,346
Morning, sir!

514
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:44,515
You see this. English?
Yes!

515
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,433
Please.

516
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,561
Ooh!

517
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,605
Tell me you've got something I
can take to the Prime Minister.

518
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,692
Would the name of the man
responsible do, sir?

519
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,610
Excellent, English, yes.

520
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,530
It's Jason...

521
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:12,167
Volta, sir. Jason Volta.

522
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,586
What?

523
00:45:13,752 --> 00:45:16,338
You're accusing the PM's
knight in shining armor?

524
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,257
I'd need hard evidence.

525
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,724
Which...

526
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,977
is why Agent English
is proposing

527
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,605
a penetration of Volta's
country estate in Surrey.

528
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:37,067
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

529
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,486
Well, do what you have
to do, English.

530
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,864
But for God's sake,
be discreet about it.

531
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,116
Oh! Oh.

532
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,242
Good.

533
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:46,410
Oh. Oh.

534
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,376
"Virtual reality"?

535
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,502
That's right, sir.

536
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,946
P's built a computer model of
the inside of Volta's mansion.

537
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:02,968
When you put on this headset, it will look
and feel as if you are inside the house.

538
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,513
You'll be able to open and close
doors, walk up and down staircases,

539
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,391
completely familiarize
yourself with its layout.

540
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:12,728
This floor moves in any
direction. 80 you can walk...

541
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,399
You can walk as far as you
want in the virtual world

542
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,611
without ever actually
leaving this room.

543
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:22,029
One thing though, sir.

544
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,949
The experience can be
very disorientating.

545
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,241
It's completely immersive

546
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,370
and some people lose all track
of their actual surroundings.

547
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,665
I think we can pretty much
guarantee that's not gonna happen.

548
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,334
I'll just need you to sign the
health and safety releases.

549
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,379
Would you excuse
me while I find an iPad.

550
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,675
Oh, go with him, Bough. If we don't
ohivvy him along we'll be here all day.

551
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,974
Hmm.

552
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,328
Ah.

Watch out!

00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,465
<i>Door Closing.</i>

556
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,425
<i>Going down.</i>

557
00:49:07,152 --> 00:49:08,320
Hey!

558
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,688
I'm sorry, sir, but you're
going to have to leave.

559
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:26,755
Ow.

560
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:28,090
Ow.

561
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,867
So, we'll shortly
be arriving at Admiralty House.

562
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:58,912
And, er, that actually used to be
Oliver Cromwell's own house. Um...

563
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,040
Uh...

564
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:05,669
And then we'll be going
to Horse Guards Parade.

565
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,215
Perhaps you'd like
to sit down, sir?

566
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,845
Hey, whoa!

567
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:20,893
I've got them!

568
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:29,526
However, the agent we have on this mission
is confident he's making major progress.

569
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:32,404
And, uh, yes, we have a potential
suspect, he's been identified.

570
00:50:32,905 --> 00:50:36,909
And further covert
investigations are now ongoing.

571
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,411
Yes, quite.

572
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:42,581
So I expect to have more
to announce on this front

573
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:45,500
shortly.

574
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,557
Oh.

575
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,434
Sir?

576
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:03,644
Mmm?

577
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,563
Is everything all right. sir?
Yes. I've done it, Bough.

578
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,566
Child's play. Don't know what
all the fuss was about.

579
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:25,165
<i>Pleasure to see you again,
Prime Minister.</i>

580
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,711
It's a hologram. Apparently
you just speak to it normally.

581
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,548
The pleasure's all mine.

582
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:37,511
Hate to rush you, but was there
something in particular you needed?

583
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,264
Actually, I was just calling
really to see

584
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:44,393
if you had had a chance
to think things over.

585
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,644
<i>I have.</i>

586
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:51,733
But the thing is, Fiona, I just don't
really do other people's security.

587
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:55,195
<i>Not that I don't want to. But
your infrastructure is old.</i>

588
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,257
Plus the only way I could keep
you secure in the meantime

589
00:51:57,281 --> 00:52:00,826
would be by storing all your
data on my own servers.

590
00:52:00,909 --> 00:52:03,036
<i>Obviously, that would be...
Yes. Jason.</i>

591
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:07,082
What I really want to do is announce
this tie-up at the G12 meeting.

592
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,294
<i>Do we have a deal?</i>

593
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,138
Good luck, sir.

594
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:40,824
Hey.

595
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:41,992
Sir?

596
00:52:42,075 --> 00:52:44,578
I said to get the chopper ready.
Right there.

597
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,871
Sir. Right away, sir.

598
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,247
Thank you.

599
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,041
- Tyler, come in.
<i>- Copy.</i>

600
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:51,418
Tyler, can you prepare
the chopper now?

601
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,338
<i>We'll have everything ready
for you in a couple of minutes.</i>

602
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,663
We can't keep meeting
like this, Mr. Golightly.

603
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,082
Oh, yes.

604
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,126
Or do you want to end this Charade
and tell me your real name?

605
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,760
There's so much you don't understand about
this world you've got caught up in.

606
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,223
Spare me the idiot act.
You're British Secret Service.

607
00:53:47,432 --> 00:53:51,186
Impressive work in France, by the way.
When did you realize I was a spy, too?

608
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:55,982
Oh, pretty much straight away.

609
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:57,901
Hmm.

610
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:04,282
I've spent two years undercover.
Simple operation until you showed up.

611
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,243
And I like
to keep things simple.

612
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,995
"Simple" is my middle name.

613
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,127
It would seem you've got
a choice to make.

614
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,675
Temporary suspension ofhosfinfies?
A short-term partnership?

615
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:31,810
Hmm.

616
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:34,938
Politicians are even more
gullible than venture capitalists.

617
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,022
<i>That is correct.</i>

618
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,386
Get me a copy
of the target list.

619
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,985
We'll hit them once more
just to be on the safe side.

620
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,655
Give me your phone.
You don't have a phone?

621
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,158
A phone will give anyone
your precise location.

622
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,910
And yet they're so useful
for making phone calls.

623
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:51,371
Excellent.
I'm not phoning anyone.

624
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,041
I'm gathering evidence.

625
00:54:56,918 --> 00:55:00,755
<i>The target list, Jason. Four
iconic central London landmarks.</i>

626
00:55:00,881 --> 00:55:02,966
<i>Make your selection.
Number three.</i>

627
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,926
<i>The London Eye.</i>

628
00:55:06,178 --> 00:55:11,391
<i>This cyber attack could potentially
impact 16,000 visitors.</i>

629
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,232
I found him snooping
around upstairs.

630
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,235
And who are you exactly?

631
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,820
I'm not telling you anything.

632
00:55:23,904 --> 00:55:24,946
Hmm.

633
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,158
<i>Face recognition
software launched.</i>

634
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,953
<i>Johnny English is a geography
teacher from Lincolnshire.</i>

635
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:36,249
Rather heavily armed for a lesson
on European capitals, Mr. English.

636
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,961
Any thoughts, sweetheart?

637
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,881
He's British Intelligence.

638
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,343
And there you have it,
two words that have

639
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:49,346
no right being
in the same sentence together.

640
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:52,724
Do you really think
I came here alone?

641
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:56,394
I have a team of crack
operatives out there, right now,

642
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,979
just waiting to strike.

643
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,356
Uh-huh.

644
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,487
<i>Sir!</i>

645
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,992
What has happened
to this country?

646
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:13,828
How is it possible
that less than a century ago

647
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,915
the British Empire
ruled a quarter of the globe

648
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,627
and now it's relying on someone

649
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,214
like you?

650
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:29,803
Hey! Stop!

651
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,138
Stop him?

652
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,070
Go.

653
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,955
- Close the gates.
- Yes, sir.

654
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,175
Help! Stop!

655
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,636
Obstacle directly ahead,
Mrs. Trattner.

656
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,682
Check your mirrors
and bring the car to a stop.

657
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:19,728
Er, excuse me. Hey.

658
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:22,731
Thank you.

659
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:27,319
Drive!

660
00:57:29,613 --> 00:57:30,614
Excuse me.

661
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,508
What... What
do you think you're doing?

662
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:35,118
Excuse me! You are
not a qualified instructor.

663
00:57:44,294 --> 00:57:46,546
But what about my instructor?
Turn left.

664
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:47,672
Oh.

665
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,591
Turn right.

666
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,556
For future reference,
I'm on your left.

667
00:57:56,890 --> 00:58:00,393
Please, stop.
I can't do this anymore!

668
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,358
I can't see anything now!

669
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:07,859
Good.

670
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:21,498
When I say "go,"
turn sharp right.

671
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,791
Uh-huh.

672
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:28,838
Three, two, one.

673
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,340
Go!

674
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,512
And straighten up,
straighten up, straighten up.

675
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:36,805
And go!

676
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,598
Let's go, let's go.

677
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:49,317
Oh, nowjust bear left
a little. Good.

678
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,111
Straighten up, straighten up.

679
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,574
Good!

680
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,997
Well, that was
very good, Mrs. Trattner.

681
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,961
I think you made
some real progress today.

682
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,065
<i>You're
not hearing me, English.</i>

683
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,151
<i>Given the Prime Minister's new friendship
with Volta, the situation has changed.</i>

684
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:18,805
But the facts haven't, sir. That
attack is Volta's responsibility.

685
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,349
According to you, but not
according to anyone else.

686
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:22,851
Is he here yet?

687
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,854
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.
So, this is, uh...

688
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,898
English, Prime Minister.
Johnny English.

689
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,693
VVhatexaofly do you have
to say for yourself?

690
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,737
Rather a lot, actually.

691
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:37,615
However, men like me don't deal
in prevarication, Prime Minister,

692
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,367
so let me get
straight to the point.

693
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:42,704
Jason Volta is the man
behind these attacks.

694
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:45,373
And I have the evidence
to prove it.

695
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,128
I managed to record this
inside Volta's country lair.

696
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,755
But I should warn you,
Prime Minister,

697
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:55,800
that what you're about to see
is evil incarnate.

698
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,012
Hmm.

699
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:04,184
<i>Here we are
at Fifi's third birthday!</i>

700
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:06,519
<i>And it's a very exciting day!</i>

701
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:11,065
<i>Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!</i>

702
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:15,278
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

703
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:20,283
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

704
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,660
Thank you.

705
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,538
Can I just ask,
what is wrong with you?

706
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,209
The country is in a state
of complete chaos.

707
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,460
The press is wetting itself,

708
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,504
and the only person
capable of saving us

709
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,839
is the man you're accusing
of high treason.

710
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:39,093
I was in the room myself when he
gave the order, Prime Minister!

711
01:00:39,219 --> 01:00:40,428
But there was a...

712
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:42,198
Do you know what I was
in the room with, English?

713
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,908
Your file, which I've read,
in its entirety,

714
01:00:43,932 --> 01:00:45,012
and I have a few questions.

715
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,643
Did you or did you not burn

716
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:49,187
the Cote de Roc restaurant in
Antibes to the ground?

717
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,355
Um...

718
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,816
And did you or did you not
fire a guided missile

719
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,567
at a peloton of French cyclists?

720
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,110
Well...

721
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,654
Before commandeering
an open-top bus

722
01:00:57,779 --> 01:00:59,906
and tossing the tour guide
off the top deck,

723
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,343
and then assaulting an 82-year-old
grandmother in a sandwich shop

724
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,619
before battering the employee
of said sandwich shop

725
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,621
with two organic
sourdough baguettes?

726
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,499
Uh, I don't remember the...

727
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:12,710
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to be me?

728
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:15,922
Hmm?

729
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,842
Do you have even
the foggiest notion

730
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:22,470
of how virtually impossible
it is to get anything done

731
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:27,267
in the face of events
and facts and voters

732
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:30,520
and that tsunami of tosspots
we call "the national press"?

733
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,982
Finally I get the chance to do
something good for my country,

734
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,316
and what happens?

735
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:38,027
The universe sends me you.

736
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,322
Well, do you know what I say?

737
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,325
I say, up the universe's arse!

738
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,494
And do you know what else I say?
You're fired.

739
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:48,621
With immediate effect.
Now get out!

740
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:53,042
And make sure I never clap eyes
on that imbecile ever again!

741
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,836
What
are you doing, sir?

742
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:41,049
What do you think I'm doing,
Bough? I'm going home.

743
01:02:41,424 --> 01:02:43,843
But the Prime Minister is
finalizing her deal with Volta.

744
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:47,221
She's taking him to the G12 Summit
in Scotland as her special guest.

745
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:51,351
It's over, Bough. And there's
absolutely nothing we can do about it.

746
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:54,729
But, sir, I have a plan.

747
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,898
Remember my wife?

748
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,075
Clear your baffles.

749
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,577
What?
Mind your head, sir.

750
01:03:09,661 --> 01:03:10,745
Ow!

751
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:15,083
This says we're sinking.

752
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:23,633
She's old and a little rusty, but she can
put on a hell of a fireworks display.

753
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,318
Excellent work, Commander.

754
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,405
Jeremy has always spoken very
highly of you, Agent English.

755
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:47,573
Who?

756
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,660
Oh.

757
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,412
Oh, yes, yes.

758
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:56,416
I'm no fan of the pen
pushers myself, so

759
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,519
when orders came through
stationing us here for the Summit,

760
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,962
well, I thought a lift was
the least I could do.

761
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:03,214
Right, let's get
a move on, Bough.

762
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,443
Oh, if you wouldn't mind
keeping your mobiles off

763
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:07,827
until you're well clear,
gentlemen.

764
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,388
The launch systems on the
missiles are a bit 1980s.

765
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:13,224
Gets a tad twitchy
around microwave radiation.

766
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:17,353
No problem there, Commander. We're
doing this mission old-school.

767
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,157
This spot is perfect.

768
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:32,076
Come on.

769
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:48,593
Sorry, sir.

770
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,136
Come on, come on...

771
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:53,765
Right, Bough. Our
mission here is simple.

772
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:57,310
Gain access to Volta's bedroom
and take him out.

773
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,807
How are you going to
get up there, though, sw?

774
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:03,357
A walk in the park
for the exoskeleton.

775
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,867
Remotely operated
neoprene bodysuit.

776
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,912
Increases the wearer's
strength 100 times.

777
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,582
Right, power it up. Stick in
the floppy disk and let's go.

778
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:28,883
Just”

779
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,567
Crikey, sir!

780
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,836
When will
the weapon be ready?

781
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,589
<i>As soon as the Prime Minister
signs the agreement, tonight.</i>

782
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:10,049
How do I fire it?

783
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,760
<i>Press once and the attack
is launched.</i>

784
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,472
<i>After which, the data
of every G12 country</i>

785
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:20,101
<i>will be transferred to the
servers on board the Dot</i> Calm.

786
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,185
Perfect.

787
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:23,938
Ah.

788
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:26,357
Cheers.

789
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:38,077
You're working for Russian Intelligence
and you have been from the start.

790
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,390
Which is why I've taken an antidote
to the poison you keep in your ring,

791
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:43,082
and which you've poured
into this drink.

792
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,128
And removed the firing pin
from that pistol.

793
01:06:55,970 --> 01:06:57,930
Everyone has to make a life
for themselves.

794
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,349
It's just sad that yours is

795
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,476
over.

796
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:03,644
Hmm.

797
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:07,023
Fresh from my 3D printer.
Hundred percent plastic.

798
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:11,903
And 100% deadly.

799
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,989
Killing me won't save you.

800
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:16,908
Don't bet on it.

801
01:07:21,662 --> 01:07:24,040
Seriously,
this cannot be happening.

802
01:07:24,248 --> 01:07:26,125
Oh, but it is.

803
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,336
Drop the gun.

804
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:30,588
Get your hands in the air.

805
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:32,548
And you.

806
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,933
There's no time
for this, Johnny.

807
01:07:42,808 --> 01:07:44,268
Oh, it isn't possible.

808
01:07:44,352 --> 01:07:47,104
You cannot be working
with this English idiot!

809
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:50,608
Save the pillow talk
for your prison cell, Volta.

810
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:54,779
Are you inside. sir? Yes. yes.
Bough. you can power down.

811
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:56,989
Everything is under control.

812
01:07:57,949 --> 01:07:59,283
Shut down.

813
01:08:23,849 --> 01:08:26,269
An historic venue
for an historic meeting.

814
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:30,273
The delegates from each G12 member
nation will have their own priorities...

815
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,160
How do we get in now, sir?

816
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:53,587
What's the plan?

817
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:30,082
Hey, you!

818
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,834
Hey!

819
01:09:47,892 --> 01:09:50,686
Thank you very much. I hope
you have everything you need.

820
01:10:07,578 --> 01:10:08,788
OW!

821
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:10,581
On behalf of the United Kingdom,

822
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:14,251
may I welcome you here today to
this ancient meeting ohamber

823
01:10:14,377 --> 01:10:16,670
where the great Scottish clans

824
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:20,549
once settled their differences
and forged new alliances.

825
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,511
A place I have
specifically chosen

826
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:26,806
in order to make
a very special announcement.

827
01:10:27,807 --> 01:10:28,808
Sir?

828
01:10:30,101 --> 01:10:34,063
Are you all right, sir? ENGLISH: No,
I'm not all right. Get me up, Bough.

829
01:10:37,775 --> 01:10:41,320
It's very heavy, sir.
I know how heavy it is. Bough.

830
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,950
We've got to get
to the conference...

831
01:10:47,868 --> 01:10:50,079
To the conference room
before Volta...

832
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,999
Before Volta triggers
his weapon.

833
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:59,338
And so, with my signature
on this agreement...

834
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:03,134
it gives me great pleasure, oh,

835
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:07,930
to welcome to you my guest,
my friend, Jason Volta.

836
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,186
<i><i>Standing
by to launch attack, Jason.</i>

837
01:11:14,478 --> 01:11:16,647
<i>Damn it. get me out of Ms stun.
Johnny?</i>

838
01:11:16,772 --> 01:11:18,875
- I can't see the join, sir.
- It's the clasp.

839
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:21,861
Release the clasp andthetop
and the bottom separate.

840
01:11:23,821 --> 01:11:25,781
Must have jammed
when you fell over, sir.

841
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,992
For goodness sake.
Wait. Try this.

842
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,876
That is quite a lot of oil, sir.

843
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,379
Oh, come on!
Come on, come on...

844
01:11:41,505 --> 01:11:45,217
Can you imagine what the world would
look like if it was run by Apple?

845
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,096
Or Google? Or...

846
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:50,723
Me?

847
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,061
Do you think
you'd have failing schools?

848
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,148
Do you think you'd have endless
waiting in your hospitals?

849
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,232
No.

850
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,068
Think you'd have such long
lines in your airports?

851
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:04,737
- No.
- No.

852
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:09,492
No, because all of these are
simple data management problems.

853
01:12:09,617 --> 01:12:12,286
And people like me,
we love data.

854
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,706
We live for data.

855
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:17,833
Hal

856
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,294
Do you know
what I live for, Volta?

857
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:21,438
God.

858
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:26,842
Eliminating the threat that lying
villains like you pose to this country.

859
01:12:27,134 --> 01:12:28,344
Oh, for God's sake.

860
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,179
Who is he?

861
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,764
Arrest this whack job.

862
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:34,975
The only person ordering an
arrest around here will be me.

863
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:38,145
There's no cause for concern,
ladies and gentlemen,

864
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:42,942
you are now in the capable hands
of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

865
01:12:43,275 --> 01:12:47,947
And you, my friend, are in for
an uncomfortable ride.

866
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,798
Where was I?

867
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,009
Living for data.

868
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,469
Exactly.

869
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:16,809
My algorithms can solve every one of your
problems as long as I have one thing.

870
01:13:16,892 --> 01:13:17,977
Control.

871
01:13:18,644 --> 01:13:21,981
And that is what you are about
to give me now.

872
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,775
Jason, I wonder
if you could just clarify...

873
01:13:24,858 --> 01:13:25,943
Shut up.

874
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,736
Now, hold on.

875
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,739
<i>Castle now locked down</i>

876
01:13:31,782 --> 01:13:34,034
<i>and under your control, Jason.</i>

877
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:38,414
The agreement this ignoramus
just signed

878
01:13:38,497 --> 01:13:41,166
didn't just give me access
to all the UK's data.

879
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:45,254
It also gave me access to a
junction box, in North Ayrshire

880
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:47,923
that connects
the entire World Wide Web.

881
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:53,887
Disable the fiber-optic cables in that box
and the Internet will cease to exist.

882
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,766
Johnny? Are you okay?

883
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,943
Have you got a phone?
We need to call for backup.

884
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,988
There's no time for backup.
I'm going after Volta.

885
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,781
And don't lose that one!

886
01:14:13,824 --> 01:14:17,745
Do you understand what it means
if I turn the Internet off?

887
01:14:17,953 --> 01:14:22,291
Cities will go dark. Planes
will fall out of the sky.

888
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,462
Trains will collide.
Law and order will break down

889
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:29,423
and the world as you know it
will be over.

890
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:32,760
Show, don't tell, right?

891
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,557
<i>Initiating attack, Jason.</i>

892
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,477
<i>Taking control of junction box.</i>

893
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:47,483
<i>Suspending Internet and electricity
supply across Britain and Europe.</i>

894
01:14:48,525 --> 01:14:50,944
<i>Stage one of attack complete.</i>

895
01:14:51,445 --> 01:14:54,740
Ladies and gentlemen.
I can stop the attack

896
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:58,327
as long as each of you signs the same
agreement as the Prime Minister,

897
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:00,412
giving me complete control.

898
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,748
Your call.

899
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:06,377
<i>Welcome to British
Intelligence. Get me Pegasus!</i>

<i>Eight G12 signatures

903
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,689

we're almost done here.

904
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:28,899
<i>For accounts, press five.</i>

906

<i>For more options, press seven.</i>

907
01:15:36,323 --> 01:15:37,324
What?

908
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:43,914
<i>Only two further signatures required

Oh, my God.

913
01:15:56,301 --> 01:16:00,013
<i>Dive the submarine.
Repeat, dive the submarine.</i>

914
01:16:02,808 --> 01:16:04,935
Director's office?
<i>This is Johnny English.</i>

915
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,273
I need to speak to Pegasus immediately.
It's a national emergency.

916
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,958
One moment, please, sir.

917
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:14,003
<i>This</i> is HMS Vengeance.

918

<i>Do I have your permission

920
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,244
Oh, my God. Could you hold on
one moment, please?

921
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:24,121
Sir? Sir!

922
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,081
Hello?

923
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:27,332
<i>Hello?</i>

924
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:30,544
Sir! HMS <i>Vengeance here.</i> Do I
<i>have</i> your permission tolaunch?

925
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:33,589
<i>What? Listen, we
have to call in an attack.</i>

926
01:16:33,672 --> 01:16:34,983
<i>Did you say
"atta ck," sir?</i>

927
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:37,342
<i>Yes, an attack. Attack.</i>

928
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,388
General quarters,
we are go for launch.

929
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:43,432
Target coordinates locked,
Commander.

Hello?

931
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:47,519
Hello?

932
01:16:57,946 --> 01:17:00,491
Commander, the
missile is being redirected.

933
01:17:01,325 --> 01:17:03,994
It seems to be looking on
to a new hostile target.

934
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:07,998
What's a "Sherbet F"?

935
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,428
Oh. no. What was that?

936
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:26,016
<i>Dot Calm appears

make a call quite close
to the submarine, sir?

940

Um...

941
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,366
Because”.

942
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,701
You did it, sir!

943
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,621
Mission accomplished!

944
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:49,665

01:18:02,928 --> 01:18:06,014
Volta is getting away! He's
heading for his helicopter!

948

No, Bough.

949

This one's mine.

950
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,554
Careful, sir. Sir?

951
01:18:56,607 --> 01:18:58,275
Last two steps, sir.

952
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:05,282
Not so fast, Volta!

953
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:08,994
Is this supposed to scare me,
Sir Lancelot?

954
01:19:14,124 --> 01:19:15,375
Take cover, Bough.

955
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,552
Don't worry, he's only got six
bullets in that thing.

956
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,724
And, of course,
the thing itself.

957
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:35,187
You've run out
of options, Volta.

958
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,314
Oh, you think you've won?

959
01:19:37,397 --> 01:19:38,607
Mmm.

960
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:42,235
<i>Rerouting the attack
to our Nevada servers, Jason.</i>

961
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:46,865
The world's going down, English.
And I'll be the last man standing.

962
01:19:47,491 --> 01:19:50,535
Goodbye, English!
Goodbye, Internet.

963
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:56,458
I've got it. That's a Gazelle
341 light attack helicopter.

964
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:59,544
If we can hack into
its operating system,

965
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:01,797
we can disable
the drive function.

966
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:03,090
Here.

967
01:20:06,927 --> 01:20:11,056
Look at you! You couldn't use that
thing if your life depended on it!

968
01:20:14,017 --> 01:20:15,394
Let's get outta here.

969
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,813
Get this steel bird in the...

970
01:20:23,026 --> 01:20:27,948
<i>Rerouting complete. Attack data
now installed at our Nevada servers.</i>

971
01:20:28,365 --> 01:20:30,158
<i>Should I initiate?</i>

972
01:20:30,575 --> 01:20:31,576
<i>Jason?</i>

973
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,417
<i>Should I initiate
the new attack?</i>

974
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:41,962
Initiate this!

975
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:44,464
<i>Jason.</i>

976
01:20:55,726 --> 01:20:57,161
Well, uh,
ladies and gentlemen.

977
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:01,064
I think we can all agree, that wasn't
quite the evening we were expecting.

978
01:21:06,403 --> 01:21:08,405
I had hoped to present
to you tonight...

979
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:10,824
Thank you... a vision of
what Britain might be.

980
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,995
But, as it happens, the man who
saved us all this evening,

981
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:18,623
the man who, I might add, I
personally assigned to this case,

982
01:21:19,249 --> 01:21:21,460
has presented us with a
different kind of vision.

983
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:25,839
A living embodiment, if you like, of
those fundamental British qualities

984
01:21:25,922 --> 01:21:30,218
that have ensured that our
beloved island nation endures.

985
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:33,638
Courage under fire,
endless ingenuity

986
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,640
and above all, a quiet

987
01:21:36,266 --> 01:21:38,977
unassailable dignity.

988
01:21:58,121 --> 01:21:59,372
Thank you.

989
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:07,964
All together.

990
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,560
Welcome back, Mr. English.

991
01:22:20,644 --> 01:22:21,812
Thank you, Headmaster.

992
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,664
Thank you for agreeing
to be our guest speaker.

993
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:26,483
Now the governors and staff are all
waiting for us in the rose garden.

994
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:29,486
Yes, if you could just excuse me
for a few minutes, Headmaster.

995
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:36,243
Oh.

996
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,371
Morning. sir!
Hello. sir!

997
01:22:39,454 --> 01:22:41,706
Welcome back, sir!

998
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:46,837
Surprise!

999
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:48,964
Thank you.

1000
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:51,758
<i>Where's Sinker?</i>

1001
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,469
Good.
Here. sir.

1002
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:56,638
And, of course, Baggaley.

1003
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,075
That was very good.
Very good.

1004
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:00,701
All right, gather round,
everyone. Gather round.

1005
01:23:01,893 --> 01:23:03,812
I've got some toys to show you.

1006
01:23:03,895 --> 01:23:05,438
Ooh!
There we go.

1007
01:23:06,523 --> 01:23:08,817
There we are. There we are.

1008
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,403
- Breadstick blowpipe. anyone?
- Me!

1009
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:12,529
There you go.

1010
01:23:12,612 --> 01:23:14,865
Granny Smith hand grenade?

1011
01:23:15,407 --> 01:23:17,409
And what about a garroting watch?
Here. sir.

1012
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:18,493
There you go.

1013
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:21,580
Ooh!
Here, let me take that.

1014
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:23,999
Don't worry. It's only a mild sedative.

1015
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,711
Oh! That's just
a five-second fuse.

1016
01:23:28,962 --> 01:23:31,590
Yes, all right, we all know
what garroting looks like.

1017
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:33,717
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. English.

1018
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,428
Oh, I'm sorry, Headmaster,
I'll just be one moment.

1019
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,722
Just take those. Thank you.
Ooh.

1020
01:23:39,598 --> 01:23:42,642
Put those away, shall we?
There we...

1021
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:44,519
Um...

1022
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,189
I always
did love a jelly baby.

1023
01:23:47,213 --> 01:23:49,213
